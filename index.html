               value: Historical Background:\nDomestication and Utilization of Dairy\nIndividuals began domesticating livestock like cows, goats, and sheep around 10,000 years ago mainly for a dependable supply of milk. This was the starting point of dairy consumption in human existence.\n\nDiscovery of Fermented Foods\nBefore the advent of refrigerators, milk tended to ferment automatically due to bacterial presence, producing the unintended products of yogurt and cheese. Fermented foods were more resilient.\n\nIntriguing Chemical Compounds or Processes\nParts and Reactions\nCasein Proteins and Curdling: Casein is the predominant protein of milk, existing in form of micelles suspended in the liquid. When an acid (lemon juice or vinegar) is added, it lowers the pH, destabilizing casein micelles and bringing about coagulation of the micelles, forming curds. It is very important in the manufacture of cheese.\nLactose and Fermentation: Lactic acid bacteria can ferment lactose, the milk sugar. Fermentation converts lactose to lactic acid by bacteria in the process, giving the end product or final serving a sour taste or acting as a natural preservative in the yogurt.\n\nApplications in Dairy Production\nCheese Production: Cheese production involves the addition of specific bacteria to milk, which ferment lactose to form lactic acid. The increased acidity, together with the addition of rennet (an enzyme), causes casein proteins to coagulate and form curds. The curds are then processed and aged to produce various types of cheese.\nYogurt Production: During yogurt production, specific bacteria strains are incorporated into milk. The bacteria ferment lactose into lactic acid, reducing the pH and thickening the milk into yogurt. Regulated fermentation establishes the flavor and texture of yogurt.\n\nImpact on Society\nNutritional Significance: Food dairy has played a significant role in providing fundamental nutrients, including calcium, protein, and vitamins, to contribute to human development and health.\nEconomic Value: The dairy industry is economically important globally, paying millions of dollars to farmers and farm workers as well as agricultural production.\nScientific Breakthroughs: Milk chemistry knowledge has led to the discovery of products such as lactose-free products that are useful to lactose-intolerant individuals.\n\nInteresting Facts\nVariety of Cheeses: There are over 1,800 types of cheese globally, each having varying flavors and textures based on specific fermentation and aging conditions.\nLactose Intolerance: The majority of the world's population is lactose intolerant, which has been the driving force behind the production of lactose-free dairy foods. These foods are manufactured through the addition of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose into more easily digestible carbohydrates.\nThe White of Milk: Milks whitish color is caused by light scattering in casein micelles and suspended fat globules in the liquid;">
